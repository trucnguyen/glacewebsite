<h3>Visioning</h3>
Based on the research data, we conducted our first brainstorming session devoted to coming up with potential solutions to issues we identified.
Visioning required us to quickly come up with rough scenarios of existing problems and opportunities where a new design could improve status-quo. Each vision is a story illustrating how a user would operate a hypothetical tool to solve their problem.

<h3>Design, Prototype, and Test</h3>
Our research findings and visions became the basis for an iterative process of designing, prototyping and testing in the Summer.
During this time we created prototypes of various fidelity: Lo-Fi (paper), Mid-Fi (Axure), and Hi-Fi (HTML & CSS). Each of them was tested with our users, and improved according to their feedback. <br />
