<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>In collaboration with Genentech, Team Glacé researched, designed, and demonstrated how technology and information can come together to bring value to Genentech’s field-based sales workforce, also known as Clinical Specialists (CSs).</p>

<p>Clinical Specialists (CS) are field-based sales professionals who develop long-term relationships with health care professionals (HCP) such as physicians, nurses, and office staff. CS educate HCP about the potential benefits and treatment strategies of the company medicines. Understanding their needs and determining how technology and information can help them effectively connect with HCPs is crucial to their success.</p>

<p>We selected "Territory Planning" as our main focus from ideas submitted by Genentech CSs to an internal incubator program called SparkTank. The primary goal of this idea is to provide CS with valuable contextual information when they find themselves with an unexpected period of free time. With this information, they can make an informed decision on how to optimize their sales calls based on their immediate area and availability of HCP. In addition, the information can also be beneficial to a new CS who is acclimating to their sales territory.</p>

<h3>Hunt Statement</h3>
Design an innovative approach to enhance communications and relationships between Clinical Specialists and prescribers in order to determine effective medical strategies and treatments.

<h3>Timeline</h3>
The project consisted of two main parts: 4 months of exploratory user research in Spring, and 3 months of iterative processes of designing, prototyping, and testing the solution in Summer.
